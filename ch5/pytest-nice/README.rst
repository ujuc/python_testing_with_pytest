pytest-nice : A pytest plugin
=============================

Makes pytest output just a bit nicer during failures.

Features
--------

- Includes user name of person running tests in pytest output.
- Adds ``--nice`` option that:

  - turns ``F`` to ``O``
  - with ``-v``, turns ``FAILURE`` to ``OPPORTUNITY for improvement``

Installation
------------

Given that our pytest plugins are being saved in .tar.gz form in the
shared directory PATH, then install like this:

::

  $ pip install PATH/pytest-nice-0.1.0.tar.gz
  $ pip install --no-index --find-links PATH pytest-nice

Usage
-----

::

  $ pytest --nice
